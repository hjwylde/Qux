Qux is an experimental language developed from the ground up with the aim of supporting extended
    static checks at compile time.

This project provides a binary for working with the Qux language.
It supports the following operations:
* `build`   --- composable version of `check`.
* `check`   --- type checking.
* `print`   --- pretty printing.
* `run`     --- interpreter.

For full usage, see `qux --help`.
